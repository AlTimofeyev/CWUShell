This is a simple shell written in C++.
The code was written, complied, and executed on Linux Ubuntu 18.04.1,
running in VirtualBox, using the g++ compiler in shell. I thing g++ is an
extension of gcc (?).

To install g++ run the following two commands in shell:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install g++

To compile code, in shell run command: g++ cwushell.cpp
To execute code, in shell run command: ./a.out

All of the existing shell commands seem to execute and work properly.
All with the exception of the command: clear
After a certain point "clear" gives a message, something about Term (?).
I'm not entirely sure how to fix this as this is my first time coding in C++
on a Linux machine and I'm only aware of a few shell commands.
